# Deforestation Prediction Using SVM

## Overview
This project aims to predict deforestation levels using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with different kernel types (Linear, Polynomial, and RBF). The model evaluates the impact of various features such as CO2 emissions, GDP, and population on deforestation.

## Model Performance Summary
### **Best Parameters Found:**
- **Kernel:** RBF
- **C:** 0.1
- **Gamma:** Scale
- **Best Score:** 0.5333

### **Performance Comparison:**

| Kernel  | MSE  | Accuracy | Precision (Class 0) | Precision (Class 1) | Recall (Class 0) | Recall (Class 1) |
|---------|------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Linear  | 0.52 | 0.48     | 0.67                | 0.42                | 0.27             | 0.80             |
| Poly    | 0.52 | 0.48     | 0.57                | 0.36                | 0.53             | 0.40             |
| RBF     | 0.44 | 0.56     | 0.62                | 0.44                | 0.67             | 0.40             |

The **RBF Kernel** performed the best in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE), indicating that it captures non-linear relationships in the data more effectively than linear or polynomial kernels.

## Analysis of Deforestation Influencing Factors
The following key features were used for classification:
1. **CO2 Emissions (Million Tons):** Higher emissions correlated with increased deforestation likelihood.
2. **Population:** Higher population densities showed mixed impacts, indicating the need for further regional analysis.
3. **GDP (Billion USD):** Economic growth may influence deforestation due to industrial expansion and land-use changes.

### Key Findings:
- **CO2 emissions have a strong correlation** with forest loss, suggesting that carbon-intensive activities significantly impact deforestation.
- **Population growth is a complex factor,** requiring further examination of urban vs. rural areas to determine specific drivers.
- **Economic policies play a crucial role** in deforestation mitigation. Regions with stricter environmental regulations exhibited lower forest loss rates.

## Recommendations for Deforestation Mitigation
Based on the model findings, the following strategies are recommended:

### **1. Policy Interventions:**
- Implement stricter carbon emission policies to regulate industries contributing to deforestation.
- Strengthen land-use laws to prevent illegal deforestation and encourage sustainable practices.

### **2. Economic Incentives:**
- Provide financial incentives for industries adopting eco-friendly alternatives.
- Support afforestation programs through tax benefits and subsidies.

### **3. Community Engagement & Awareness:**
- Launch educational campaigns on the importance of sustainable land use.
- Involve local communities in conservation projects to promote long-term commitment.

### **4. Technological and Data-Driven Approaches:**
- Use AI and remote sensing to monitor deforestation in real time.
- Implement predictive analytics to identify high-risk areas for proactive mitigation.

## Conclusion
The study indicates that **CO2 emissions, economic growth, and population trends significantly influence deforestation.** The **RBF SVM model** provided the best classification results, highlighting the importance of non-linear relationships in the dataset. By implementing data-driven policies and sustainable economic strategies, deforestation can be effectively mitigated while balancing economic growth and environmental conservation.
